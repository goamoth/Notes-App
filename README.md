This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

In this project I demonstrate simple CRUD operations on a react frontend app. 
This is a frontend of a full MERN stack application with the API running on port 4000 localhost. 
Tried to make the code simple to understand by using self descriptive variable and function names.
Cheers!
